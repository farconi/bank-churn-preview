| Betabank Churn Preview | In this project, we developed a predictive model to identify customers who are more likely to churn from the bank. We employed class balancing techniques and parameter tuning to improve the model's performance. With the enhanced model, Beta Bank can take proactive measures to retain customers and strengthen its customer base. | *pandas*, *matplotlib*, *seaborn*, *sklearn* |
